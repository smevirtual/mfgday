## Manufacturing Day Materials

Resources, slides and other written content for [Manufacturing Day](https://www.mfgday.com/)
events that are hosted by the SME Virtual Network and participating SME Virtual
Network contributors.

The SME Virtual Network believes in inspiring, educating and engaging with future
generations of manufacturers to shrink the skills gap. Therefore, our participation
in Manufacturing Day aligns very much with our goals.

We encourage all manufacturers open their doors and minds to area students who
could, one day, take your business and community to the next level.

### About the SME

The SME is an international organization which seeks to develop engineering and
manufacturing talent, promote advanced manufacturing technology and, ultimately,
build a more prosperous tomorrow for the manufacturing community.

### About the SME Virtual Network

The SME Virtual Network is a volunteer-led online community for SME members,
non-members, emerging professionals and students. It was created to engage
remote areas that do not have the support of a local SME chapter; busy community
members who may not have the time to participate in face-to-face events; and
manufacturing professionals who do shift work.

In short, it is designed to enhance the traditional SME chapter experience. We
strive to provide value-added virtual events and engagement opportunities for
the manufacturing and engineering community.
